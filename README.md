# REGRESSION MODEL ON A DATASET

## SHAPIRO-WILK TEST RESULTS
Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality: p-value = 0.6531

From the above p-value, the distribution is a normal distribution.
N/B: Shapiro-wilk test for Noramlity isn't so efficient for data set where N>5000

In this case, I used a N value of 10,000.
