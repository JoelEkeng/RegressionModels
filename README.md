# REGRESSION MODEL ON A DATASET

In this sample dataset, the following models were used

1. Linear Regression Model
2. Multiple Regression Model
3. RIDGE Regression Model
4. Decison Tree Regression Model
5. Support Vector Machine Model
6. Random Forest Regression Model

## SHAPIRO-WILK TEST RESULTS
Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality: p-value = 0.6531

From the above p-value, the distribution is a normal distribution.
N/B: Shapiro-wilk test for Noramlity isn't so efficient for data set where N>5000

In this case, I used a N value of 10,000.
